The Neural Network architecture consists of Convolutional neural networks and Recurrent neural networks. First all the videos are split into a constant number of frames(We used 40). Then this frames are fed into a CNN model to train it. The dense layer output of the CNN is then input for the RNN. The data is taken from the UFC 101 dataset.
